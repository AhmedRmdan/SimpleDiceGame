<h1 id="simpledicegame">SimpleDiceGame</h1>
<p>This is my first ever small Python project.</p>
<p>I made this simple dice game after watching the first 64 small videos of the <a href="https://github.com/OsamaElzero">OsamaElzero</a> Python course on YouTube.</p>
<p>The first 64 small videos (5 min average) covered the simple Python basics until the functions lessons.</p>
<p>Although my code imports <code>random</code> and <code>NumPy</code>,<br>
the course did NOT cover anything related to importing or using modules and libraries yet (lesson 64).</p>
<p>I learned how to use the basic functions of those libraries by searching and reading documentation.</p>
<p>My code might look horrible to read, use, and maintain, but Iâ€™m just practicing my first project.</p>
