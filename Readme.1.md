# SimpleDiceGame
This is my first ever small Python project.

I made this simple dice game after watching the first 64 small videos of the [OsamaElzero](https://github.com/OsamaElzero) Python course on YouTube.

The first 64 small videos (5 min average) covered the simple Python basics until the functions lessons.

Although my code imports `random` and `NumPy`,
the course did NOT cover anything related to importing or using modules and libraries yet (lesson 64).

I learned how to use the basic functions of those libraries by searching and reading documentation.

My code might look horrible to read, use, and maintain, but I'm just practicing my first project.
